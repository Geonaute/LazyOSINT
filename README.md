# Intro

LazyOSINT born from a simple Bash script I made to automate the initial enumeration during my internship last summer. The decision to switch to Python and improve it came last October when I had to decide what to develop as my final year project.

LazyOSINT uses sublist3r by aboul3la in order to passively gather all the subdomains availables from all the sources listed in sublist3r. Then it resolves all the subdomains and query Shodan to enumerate potential open ports and the respective headers.

While that enumeration runs, using Selenium, it retrieves all the employees from the companyâ€™s LinkedIn account. In case of a private user, a quick google search is done trying to reveal the real name behind that hidden profile. Unfortunately, the queries to Google are limited but all the intelligences are saved and the research can be manually carried out.

I am aware of the fact that it might be a bit messi, open to suggestions by whoever feels like giving some tips.

# Installation

To use Shodan please put the API key in the file `API_KEYS.conf` .

### Installing python-pip for python 3.8 and Libreoffice
```
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
sudo python3.8 get-pip.py
```

### Installing Sublist3r
```
git clone https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r.git
cd Sublist3r/
sudo python3.8 setup.py install
cd ..
```

### Installi LazyOSINT
```
cd LazyOSINT-master/
pip3.8 install -r requirements.txt
./main -h
```


# Usage Examples
#### Run a full domain enumeration targeting "londonmet.ac.uk", save the database "myDatabaseName" and the log file "myLogFile".
```
./main.py -f myDatabaseName -d londonmet.ac.uk -l myLogFile
```

#### Run the linkedin scraping module against LondonMet Linkedin page using as a ALREADY EXISTING linkedin account email "example@gmail.com" with password "password" and save all the data database "myDatabaseName".
If you do not specify the LinkedIn password in the command line it will be asked later.
```
./main.py -f myDatabaseName -u https://www.linkedin.com/school/london-metropolitan-university/ -e example@gmail.com -p password
```

#### Run the linkedin scraping module and a full domain enumeration.
```
./main.py -f myDatabaseName -u https://www.linkedin.com/school/london-metropolitan-university/ -e example@gmail.com -d londonmet.ac.uk -l myLogFile
```


# TODO
Potential TODO list to complete if I ever survive to OSCP:
- check if password was the right one in selenium
- find more than 1k employees (linkedin limit to 100 pages)
- use proxy for google - not working, still reCAPTCHA
